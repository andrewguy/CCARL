# CCARL

A repository for code associated with the "Carbohydrate Classification Accounting for Restricted Linkages" (CCARL) tool.

This tool enables identification of key motifs from glycan microarray data.

Additionally, it can also be used to classify binding to glycans with unknown binding behaviour (given a set of glycan microarray data for a given glycan-binding protein).
